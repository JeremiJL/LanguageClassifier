Instructions
Implement a 1-layer neural network recognizing the
language of a given text .

Neural network has as many neurons as the number of unique languages
in a dataset. Neural network should recognize this
number automatically based on the training data.

Input vectors:

Input vector represents the proportion of each ascii
letter in a given text.

Output:

Each neuron calculates its linear output (net).
Use the maximum selector to find which neuron is activated (1)
and assume that other neurons are not activated (0).

Training:

Delta rule can be used.After each training
step weight vectors may be normalized to improve classification.

Data:

Create a training dataset by yourself. Create 3-4 separate
folders and name them to represent
languages (pl, en, de ...) . Each language folder
contains text files (10+) in a specified
language - one file contains a few paragraphs of text.

Make sure that the language you choose can be represented by ascii.

Testing:

Provide an interface to input a short text
that will be classified by your program.
