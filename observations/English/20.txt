When we calculate the elasticity of demand, we usually calculate it as the percent change in quantity demanded by the percent change in price. However, this method will give you different values depending on if you calculate the elasticity from point A to B or from B to A. But what if there was a way to calculate the elasticity of demand and avoid this frustrating issue? Well, good news for us, there is! If you want to learn about the midpoint method, you've come to the right spot! Let's get started!
