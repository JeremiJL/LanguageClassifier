Cole didn’t spend the whole song on Kendrick but threw what he deemed a “warning shot” at his one-time friend. He employed Jay-Z’s “Takeover” tactic, summing up Kendrick’s catalog: “Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic / Your second shit put niggas to sleep, but they gassed it / Your third shit was massive and that was your prime / I was trailin’ right behind and I just now hit mine.” Cole also criticized Kendrick’s sparse release schedule: “He averagin’ one hard verse like every thirty months or somethin’ / If he wasn’t dissin’, then we wouldn’t be discussin’ him.” But then he walked back the vitriol, also rhyming, “don’t make me have to smoke this nigga ’cause I fuck with him,” and on the track’s second beat, produced by T-Minus and Conductor Williams, he admits, “I’m hesitant, I love my brother, but I’m not gonna lie / I’m powered up for real, that shit would feel like swattin’ a fly.” If this was a 106 & Park Freestyle Friday competition, I’d imagine a judge asking Cole if he was actually battling or not.
