Prior to European colonization, the territory was originally inhabited by Native Americans, most speaking the Arawak language, of the Arawakan language family. The people identified as Lokono. The first French establishment is recorded in 1503, but France did not establish a durable presence until colonists founded Cayenne in 1643.
Guiana was developed as a slave society,
where planters imported Africans as enslaved labourers on large sugar and other plantations in such number as to
increase the population.
