The solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, was a total solar eclipse visible across a band covering parts of North America, from Mexico to Canada
and crossing the contiguous United States. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby obscuring the Sun.
A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight. Totality occurs only 
in a limited path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a larger surrounding region.

The Moon's apparent diameter was 5.5 percent larger than average. With a magnitude of 1.0566, the eclipse's longest duration of totality 
was 4 minutes and 28.13 seconds just 4 mi (6 km) north of the Mexican town of Nazas, Durango.

This eclipse was the first total solar eclipse visible from Canada since February 26, 1979; the first over Mexico since July 11, 1991; and the first over
the United States since August 21, 2017. No other solar eclipse in the 21st century will be totally visible from all three countries. The next total solar
eclipse in the US will be on March 30, 2033, which will pass over Alaska; the next total eclipse in the lower 48 states of the US will be on August 23,
2044; and the next total eclipse of similar width will take place on August 12, 2045 (traversing coast-to-coast in a similar trajectory to the 2017 eclipse).

The final solar eclipse of the year will occur on October 2, 2024.
