Rishi Sunak claimed Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner had failed to provide
straight answers to questions about the sale of the Labour deputy leaderâ€™s council house.
The Prime Minister sought to apply the pressure to Sir Keir and Ms Rayner
as he faced questions over his handling of the William Wragg honeytrap affair.
Mr Wragg last night voluntarily resigned the Tory whip and Mr Sunak was
asked this morning why he had not taken action against him after the MP admitted
involvement in the scandal.
